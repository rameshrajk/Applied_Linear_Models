### a)
```{r}
#import data
sysbp=read.csv("hw2_systolic_bp.csv")
y=sysbp$sys.bp
x=sysbp$ï..weight
#fit model
lmsb=lm(y~x)
summary(lmsb)
```
### b)
y-hat = 69.10437 + 0.41942x

### c)
An intercept of 69.10437 means the value of systolic pressure is 69.10437 when the weight is zero and a slope of 0.41942 means for a unit change in the weight, systolic pressure increases by 0.4194 on average.

### d)
Null hypothesis: H0: β1=0
<br />
Alt. hypothesis: H1: β1/=0

t value of 5.979 and p value of 3.59e-06 < 0.05 => reject H0 so weight is statistically significant at 5% significance level

### e)
```{r}
lmsb2 <- lm(y~x+offset(-50*x))
summary(lmsb2)
```
Null hypothesis: H0: β1=-50
<br />
Alt. hypothesis: H1: β1/=-50

t value of 718.714 and p value of 2e-16 < 0.05 => reject H0 at 5% significance level so slope is not equal to -50.
